# IWOPY Example: Multi-objective geometric problem

In this example a chain of blobs in two dimensions is subject to 
two objectives. One attempts to maximize the extension of the chain
inx direction, the other in y direction.

## Solve with pymoo.NSGA2

Run with default parameters:
```
python run_pymoo.py
```

Check the options by adding the `-h` flag.
