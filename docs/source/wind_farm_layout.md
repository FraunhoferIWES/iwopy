# Wind farm layout optimization

A more complex application of the `iwopy` interface can be found [among the examples](https://fraunhoferiwes.github.io/foxes.docs/notebooks/layout_opt.html) of the wind farm and wake modelling Python software [foxes](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes).

Other examples in that context can be found in as part of the [foxes github repository](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes/tree/main/examples/foxes.opt).
