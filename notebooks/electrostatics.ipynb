    "There are $2 N$ variables for this problem, and we order them as $(x_0, y_0, \\ldots, x_{N-1}, y_{N-1})$. This is convenient, since the numpy reshaping operation `vars_float.reshape(n_charges, 2)` then represents an array of $(x_i, y_i)$ type arrays, which is handy for calculations.\n",

    "The difference between the two functions is that `apply_individual` evaluates a single vector of new problem variables, whereas `apply_population` handles a full population of such vectors. The implementation of the latter function is not strictly required (alternatively a loop over individuals of the population will be evaluated), but it provides a chance for a vast speed-up by vectorized evaluation. This is particularly beneficial for genetic algorithms or other easily vectorizable approaches (in fact also the gradient calculation via `iwopy` discretizations makes use of this vectorization). Of course the chosen optimizer must be able to support vectorized evaluation for this to work. Both functions return any kind of evaluation data which will be forwarded to the objective and constraint evaluation.\n",
