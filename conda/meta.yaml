  description: |
    The software iwopy is a modular wind farm simulation and wake
    modelling toolbox which is based on engineering wake models. It
    has many applications, for example wind farm optimization,
    wind farm post-construction analysis, wake model studies, and
    wind farm simulations invoking complex model chains.
